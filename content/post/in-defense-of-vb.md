The most recent stack overflow developer survey at the time of this writing has rated Visual Basic 6 the most hated programming language for the third year in a row.  “Most hated” is defined as the  language most begrudgingly used by developers at their day job. That is probably putting it lightly.  It is hard to find much buzz or friendly enthusiasm for Visual Basic.  In fact, most online opinion for VB seems to be split into two camps: those coming from other languages who are sick of its lack of modernity, or VB veterans who are upset with the constant modernization of the language. After all, it is old and somewhat domain specific.  And though it is the foundation of many legacy windows applications, their source codes don’t quite have that special antiquity needed to trigger fond memories and appeal within programmers old and new alike.  

In third place is VB.Net, the "modern" flavor of Visual Basic retrofitted to integrate with the .NET platform.  It is one of three languages available in the .NET Common Language Runtime, and yet, its functionally identical yet better looking cousin C# is sits far ahead at #6 on the “most loved” languages list.  Ouch.

Now, I would argue that the stack overflow survey is silicon skewed.  By that I mean, of course stack overflow users love the programming languages that you would prefer to greenfield your startup with.  In the cutthroat, changing web world, frequent forays into new platforms and languages happen justifiably, albeit a little eagerly.  And just like how the ageist Silicon Valley tech unicorn companies view employees under the age of 30, VB.Net seems to be that experienced old fart who just won’t retire.

I fall into the category of programmers who use VB.Net, but not by choice.  A few months prior, VB.Net was a language I have never worked with on platform that I had only a passing familiarality with.  But I've always maintained that darn adorable opinion that all languages have something to teach us and can at least do _some_ thing really well.  In the case of VB.Net, it's not that long of a list.  But it's worth mentioning its strong points since there don't seem to be many lists of this kind on the internet.  I think some positivity once in a while, after all :)

## VB.Net can do anything your fancy shmancy C# can do

 VB.Net has _feature parity_ with C#.  It has access to more of the .NET ecosystem than the haskell-y F#.  Its future roadmap has it driving side-by-side with C# as the excellently maintained language continues to grow.  This is probably the best feature of VB.Net.  You want iterators? You've got iterators.  You want to use LINQ? Why not!  You wanna cut the threading crap and use `async`? VB.Net can do that too.

 As with most languages, all intrinsic strengths come from its expressibility and design.  Its power truly comes from its habitat: an effective compiler, a strong VM/engine, tooling and dependencies, etc.  The .NET platform is a good home for Visual Basic, or any other programming language that is given the wheel.  Sure, it is not always a transparent experience, but the tradeoff I get is ease and stability, letting me work on the top-level problem without having to worry about the support beams.

 As someone who is not versed on the history of Visual Basic nor has the patience to google its history, it was surpirsing to find a sect of programmers who actively _disliked_ the current see-sharpified direction of VB.Net.  To me, the fact that it was a core .NET language was the _only_ reason I would use it.  But after using.
