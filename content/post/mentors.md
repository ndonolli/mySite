Software engineers are often trying to save the world.  In dire situations, hackers have the power to help a struggling people, such as when a [free, open-sourced VPN server](https://github.com/jlund/streisand) was distributed to Turkish citizens fighting state-level internet censorship.  Other times, the impact is localized within our neighborhoods, using technology as platform to solve everyday problems.  Like ideas, software code is conceptualized and distributed in a similar, free fashion. As technology becomes cheaper, and the knowledge to utilize said technology grows accessible, the barrier preventing humanitarian efforts grows smaller and smaller

Alternatively, New York Times columnist David Brooks [recently opined](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/opinion/giving-away-your-billion-warren-buffett.html) how he would save the world if he had a billion dollars.  In Warren Buffett's [Giving Pledge Campaign](https://givingpledge.org/), other billionaires pledge to donate the majority of their vast wealth during their lifetime, writing letters detailing how they will give away their money.  Not surprisingly, most choose charitable organizations and educational institutions.  Mr. Brooks proposed a more communal solution for using the money.  He would fund programs that establish loving relationships within disadvantaged neighborhoods. The theoretical billion could sponsor collectives of people around the country, who meet once a week and offer support for each other as they traverse life's challenges together.

Funding philanthropic efforts and distributing software scripts are different forms of altruism, but are fundamentally driven by a shared desire to help people.
