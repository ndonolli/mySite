I am not good with vim.  I use it for git commits and for when my *bash-fu* is not strong enough to make file changes with one command.  I like it better than nano.

For a while now, I've been trying to change my ways.  vim is everywhere.  It's on Linux.  Linux is everywhere.  To achieve at least some level of proficiency with the vim text editor could give one a tremendous advantage working within a shell.  I grew tired of my walking-on-eggshells workflow of *press i -> press keys -> press ESC + :wq and pray* to touch files, and decided enough was enough - **I was going to actually learn vim.**

But it hasn't happened yet.  I still switch to the arrow keys when my stream of *hjkls* spaz out the cursor.  The other day I accidentally recorded a macro and didn't know how to stop it (my current solution: quit vim). Yes, I could be devoting more time to it.  No, I haven't set my IDE to vim mode.  Somewhere along the journey, possibly before it even started, I stopped caring.  And so the conflict remains: should I care?  Will learning vim make me a more effective software engineer?

I believe the answer is a soft *maybe*.  vim is old, but it withstood the test of time and won the hearts and minds of many a developer.  The fact that vim is more alive than ever is actually pretty amazing.  vim is much older than me - the first computer I recall using was an IBM Aptiva running Windows 95, which was released four years after vim and even longer after its precursor vi was a POSIX standard.  Modern computers can run newer, heavier IDEs with little difference in speed, and yet vim remains the IDE of choice for many older and even newer software developers.
